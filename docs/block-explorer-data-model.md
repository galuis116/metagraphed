# Block Explorer Data Model

This is the reference for "what does a block actually contain, what does a full archive
node expose, and what does a real Bittensor block explorer need to show" — researched and
verified 2026-07-08 (source-level, against live polkadot-sdk, plus a direct competitor
audit of taostats.io and taomarketcap.com). Read this before re-researching any of it.

## Blocks, extrinsics, and events

A Substrate block has a header (block number, parent hash, `state_root`, `extrinsics_root`,
`digest`) and a body: an ordered list of **extrinsics**.

**Extrinsics are the input.** Substrate's general term for "things included and executed in
a block" — broader than "transaction": it covers user-signed calls (`SubtensorModule.set_weights`)
and **inherents**, special extrinsics the block author inserts itself, not signed by any user
(every block's extrinsic #0 is `Timestamp.set`).

**Events are the output** — the log of what happened as a _result_ of executing extrinsics.
One extrinsic can produce zero, one, or many events. Every extrinsic ends in exactly one
`System.ExtrinsicSuccess` or `System.ExtrinsicFailed` event (source of the `success` column
on `extrinsics`).

The `phase` field ties them together. Verified directly against block #8,575,300: events
0–270 all had `phase=Initialization` — fired automatically at the _start_ of block execution,
before any extrinsic ran (emission distribution, scheduled weight-reveals — none triggered by
a user). Events 271+ had `phase=ApplyExtrinsic`, each tagged with the causing `extrinsic_index`.
Execution order for every block: **Initialization events → extrinsics execute in order, each
producing its own events → Finalization events (if any).** Replaying a block's extrinsics
against the prior block's state deterministically produces both the new state and this log —
that determinism is what consensus is built on.

## The gap: extrinsics + events give you a log, not a snapshot

Events are a log of _changes_, not a snapshot of _current values_. A `Balances.Transfer` event
tells you money moved; it doesn't hand you "this account's balance right now." Point-in-time
values (an account's exact balance, a hotkey's stake, a neuron's weight vector) at a specific
historical block require querying **state/storage**, not replaying events.

This is what "archive node" means, distinct from an events indexer: the archive node retains
the full state trie at every historical block. Verified from live polkadot-sdk source
(`substrate/client/db/src/lib.rs`, `substrate/client/cli/src/params/pruning_params.rs`):
pruning has **two independent axes**.

- `--state-pruning` (`PruningMode::{ArchiveAll, ArchiveCanonical, Constrained(n)}`, default
  keeps only the last 256 blocks' state) — governs the **state trie**.
- `--blocks-pruning` (`BlocksPruning::{KeepAll, KeepFinalized, Some(n)}`, default
  `archive-canonical`) — governs **block bodies and justifications**.

A node can retain full block/extrinsic/event history forever (`blocks-pruning=archive`) while
still discarding all state older than 256 blocks (`state-pruning=256`, the default) — it'll
happily serve `chain_getBlock`/events back to genesis, but any `state_getStorage` call at an
old block fails with a pruned-state error. **Only `state-pruning=archive` keeps the full
historical trie.** `--pruning archive` (the legacy single flag) is a clap alias for
`--state-pruning` ONLY — it does not set `--blocks-pruning`, which silently defaults to
`archive-canonical` if not passed explicitly. Both flags must be set explicitly for a true,
complete archive node.

## What a full archive node exposes beyond `chain_getBlock` + `system_events`

Verified against live polkadot-sdk source, 2026-07-08:

- **`state_getStorage`/`getStorageAt`/`getKeysPaged`/`getPairs`/`getReadProof`** — direct
  historical state reads at an arbitrary block. Requires `state-pruning=archive`.
- **`state_call`** (aliased `state_callAt`) — execute any Runtime API method against a
  historical block's state. This is how you get _computed_ values (e.g. a chain-defined
  aggregate like subnet/neuron info) rather than one raw storage key. Same archive-depth
  requirement as above. Parity's own guidance: prefer custom Runtime APIs + `state_call` over
  bespoke RPC endpoints — a Runtime API upgrades with the runtime, no node restart needed.
- **Header fields we don't currently store**: `state_root`, `extrinsics_root` (Merkle
  commitments), `digest` (Aura consensus logs — the slot number and the author's seal
  signature, letting you independently verify block authorship without re-executing it).
- **GRANDPA justifications** (`grandpa_proveFinality`) — finality proofs, but **sparsely
  stored even on a full archive node**: only at authority-set-change blocks, every
  `justification_period` blocks, and the current finalized tip. `grandpa_proveFinality`
  reconstructs a proof for any block by walking to the nearest stored one. Retention is also
  gated by `--blocks-pruning archive`.
- **`archive_v1_*`** — a JSON-RPC v2 surface **stabilized June 2026** (`polkadot-sdk` release
  `stable2506`), purpose-built for archivers/indexers, intended to eventually replace the ad
  hoc `state_*`/`chain_*` combination: `genesisHash`, `hashByHeight` (correctly handles
  forks — multiple hashes per height, unlike `chain_getBlockHash`'s one-hash assumption),
  `header`, `body`, `finalizedHeight`, `call` (the `state_call` equivalent), and `storage`/
  `storageDiff` as **streaming subscriptions** designed for bulk indexer reads rather than
  one-off blocking calls. Build future state-ingestion against this, not the older methods.

## What a real Bittensor block explorer needs (benchmarked against taostats.io and taomarketcap.com)

taostats.io is the dominant, most feature-complete explorer. TaoMarketCap is the strongest
"second" — notably has a "Conviction" tab (subnet-owner exit-lock vesting tracker) taostats
lacks, a real differentiator worth matching or beating.

**Block/extrinsic/event pages** — foundation we already have, verified accurate:

- Block page: header + Extrinsics tab + Events tab (taostats hides the first ~30 System
  events by default — worth copying).
- Extrinsic detail page: decoded call name/params, signer, fee, linked events — a full
  decoder. We already store `call_args` as JSONB, so the raw material exists.
- Site-wide `/blocks`, `/extrinsics`, `/events`, `/runtime` (spec-version change history),
  `/sudo` (root-origin calls) tables.

**Account pages**: balance breakdown (staked-to-root / staked-in-alpha / free / liquidity-pool
/ reserved), alpha holdings per subnet/validator, transfer + stake-transaction history. The
history is event-log-derived (buildable from what we have now). **The current balance
breakdown is a state snapshot, not derivable from events alone.**

**Subnet pages**: identity, market data (price/mcap/volume — needs a price/DEX data source we
don't have), and **hyperparameters** (rho, kappa, tempo, immunity period, commit-reveal
settings, etc.) — live state values, not events.

**The metagraph** (per-neuron: UID, stake weight, VTrust, consensus, incentive, dividends,
emission, "Updated" = blocks since last weight-set) — **fundamentally a state snapshot**.
Already captured today via a separate pipeline (`scripts/fetch-metagraph-native.py`, run on the
indexer box's own `data-refresh-cron` systemd timer as of 2026-07-13, previously GitHub Actions'
`refresh-metagraph.yml` → Postgres `neurons`/`neuron_daily`) — see the block-explorer completion
roadmap issue tree for the one confirmed remaining gap (subnet hyperparameters).

**Validator dashboards, historical time-series** (price charts, registration-cost charts,
historical metagraph snapshots) — mix of event-derived and state-derived data.

## Our current data model vs. the gap

We capture the **log layer** — `blocks` (curated subset), `extrinsics`, `chain_events`,
`account_events` — via the indexer decoding live blocks + events. Verified accurate via
direct independent cross-check against two sources with zero shared infrastructure with our
indexing pipeline (our own archive node for a historical block, `entrypoint-finney.opentensor.ai`
for a live one): perfect parity, both extrinsic and event content, exact order.

Per-neuron metagraph state is now served from Postgres (`neurons`/`neuron_daily`, ADR 0014's
#4771 cutover, flipped 2026-07-10) — the ADR-0013-era `economics_history` table was superseded
by folding economics columns into D1's/Postgres's `subnet_snapshots` (migration 0008) instead,
and has been removed from `deploy/postgres/schema.sql` as dead schema. Check D1's route list in
`workers/config.mjs` before assuming a chain-data tier is missing, the two can diverge.

The one confirmed, unfiled capture gap is **subnet hyperparameters** — no pipeline captures
these anywhere. Everything else needed for full explorer parity is a derived view or narrow
enrichment on already-accurate data, not new chain-state capture. See the block-explorer
completion roadmap issue tree for the full breakdown.

Price/market data is a separate problem again — not a state read in the simple sense, needs
a decision on data source (on-chain bonding-curve state vs. an external price feed).

## Governance/Sudo pallet audit (#4310/2.1, 2026-07-08)

The competitor benchmark (taostats.io) describes a generic Substrate governance shape
(20-member Proposer → 3-member Triumvirate 7-day vote → 16-32-voter Senate 48h 75%/51%
thresholds) — **subtensor does not have this.** Confirmed against live finney runtime metadata
(bittensor 10.5.0, `SubtensorApi(network="finney").substrate.metadata`):

```
ALL PALLETS: AdminUtils, AlphaAssets, Aura, Balances, BaseFee, Commitments, Contracts,
Crowdloan, Drand, EVM, EVMChainId, Ethereum, Grandpa, LimitOrders, MevShield, Multisig,
Preimage, Proxy, RandomnessCollectiveFlip, SafeMode, Scheduler, SubtensorModule, Sudo, Swap,
System, Timestamp, TransactionPayment, Utility
```

No `Council`, `Senate`, `SenateMembers`, `TechnicalCommittee`, `Triumvirate`, `Democracy`, or
`Referenda` pallet exists. Only two pallets carry the governance-adjacent surface:

- **`Sudo`** — calls: `sudo`, `sudo_as`, `sudo_unchecked_weight`, `set_key`, `remove_key`.
  Storage: `Key` (`Optional<AccountId>`, the current sudo holder — live value on 2026-07-08:
  `5DcSqBNqCmfdJZRGFSwwcRb2dZdJHZuKK8Tb1Gx8gbmF5E8s`). Events: `Sudid`, `KeyChanged`,
  `KeyRemoved`, `SudoAsDone`.
- **`AdminUtils`** — subtensor's own root-origin admin-config pallet, ~83 calls (almost all
  `sudo_set_*`, e.g. `sudo_set_kappa`, `sudo_set_tempo`, `sudo_set_immunity_period`,
  `sudo_set_min_burn`/`sudo_set_max_burn`, `sudo_set_commit_reveal_weights_enabled`,
  `sudo_set_liquid_alpha_enabled`, `sudo_set_bonds_moving_average` — the same fields
  `subnet_hyperparams`, #4303, captures). Only 6 of the 83 calls emit a dedicated `AdminUtils`
  event (`PrecompileUpdated`, `Yuma3EnableToggled`, `BondsResetToggled`, `BurnHalfLifeSet`,
  `BurnIncreaseMultSet`, `SubnetEmissionEnabledSet`) — the reliable source for the rest is the
  extrinsic itself (`call_module = 'AdminUtils'`, decoded `call_args`).

Both `call_module` values are confirmed present in the captured `extrinsics` D1 tier: `Sudo`
had zero calls in the last ~104k blocks (~2 weeks) sampled 2026-07-08; `AdminUtils` had 57 in
the same window — this is where real activity happens. Epic #4310's 2.2 (`/api/v1/sudo`) and
2.3 (AdminUtils config-change feed, re-scoped from the original Council/Senate framing) and 2.4
(current Sudo key, re-scoped from Senate/Council membership) are built directly on this audit.

## Nested-call decode depth (#4319/4.1, 2026-07-09)

Question: does `call_args` already contain the fully-decoded inner calls of a
`Utility.batch`/`batch_all`/`force_batch` extrinsic, or just call indices that would need a
follow-up decode step? **Confirmed: `call_args` already contains the fully-decoded nested
calls.** 4.2 (nested-call rendering), 4.3 (Multisig), and 4.4 (Proxy) are pure rendering —
no backend decode addition needed.

Verified live against `GET /api/v1/extrinsics?call_module=Utility&call_function=<batch|
batch_all|force_batch>&limit=1` for all three call functions. Example (`batch_all`, block
8,581,077, extrinsic 18):

```json
"call_args": [{
  "name": "calls",
  "type": "Vec<RuntimeCall>",
  "value": [{
    "call_index": "0x0759",
    "call_function": "remove_stake_limit",
    "call_module": "SubtensorModule",
    "call_args": [
      { "name": "hotkey", "type": "AccountId", "value": "5E4z3h9y...ULde" },
      { "name": "netuid", "type": "NetUid", "value": 99 },
      { "name": "amount_unstaked", "type": "AlphaBalance", "value": 200000000000 },
      { "name": "limit_price", "type": "TaoBalance", "value": 14517744 },
      { "name": "allow_partial", "type": "bool", "value": false }
    ],
    "call_hash": "0xf500a2ad...cf7054c"
  }]
}]
```

`batch` and `force_batch` samples (including multi-call batches) confirm the identical shape:
each inner call carries `call_module`, `call_function`, a fully-expanded `call_args` list, and
its own `call_hash` — everything a renderer needs per inner call with zero extra decoding.

This repo does no recursive decode of its own — `scripts/fetch-events.py`'s `_extrinsic_call`
(`call.get("call_args")` → `_safe_json`) and `src/extrinsics.mjs`'s `formatExtrinsic`
(`JSON.parse(row.call_args)`) are both flat pass-throughs. The nesting is already present in
`substrate-interface`'s decoded `Call`-type SCALE output (pinned `==1.8.1`,
`.github/workflows/backfill-events.yml`) before this repo ever sees it — the recursion happens
inside the library's decoder, not in application code. The same `Call`-typed decode applies to
any nested-call argument (Multisig's `call`/`call_hash`, Proxy's `real`/`call`), so 4.3/4.4
should see the identical fully-decoded shape.

One caveat for 4.2: per-inner-call **success** is not part of `call_args` — it comes from
`Utility.ItemCompleted`/`BatchInterrupted` events and needs correlating separately by
`extrinsic_index` (`account_events`/`chain_events`, same join `_extrinsic_success_map` already
does for the outer extrinsic). No schema change is needed either way — `migrations/0015_
extrinsic_call_args.sql`'s `call_args TEXT` column already holds this shape as-is.

## Governance/Sudo pallet audit continued: registration-burn pallet audit (#4339/8.4, 2026-07-09)

Question (#4343's own framing): is the per-registration TAO-recycled amount "derivable from
burn-on-registration extrinsics already in the log layer, not new RPC capture"? **No — that
premise doesn't hold.** Verified empirically against live finney (bittensor 10.4.0) at a real
`burned_register` extrinsic (block 8,582,122, extrinsic 14, netuid 101):

- The extrinsic's own `call_args` carries only `netuid` + `hotkey` — no amount.
- Its `fee_tao` (0.00213142) is the ordinary per-byte transaction fee, unrelated to the burn.
- `substrate.get_events(block_hash)` at that exact `extrinsic_idx` shows the burn actually posts
  as a plain `Balances::Withdraw` event (`amount: 2131420` rao — coincidentally close to the fee
  in this sample, not the same field) alongside `SubtensorModule::NeuronRegistered` and
  `SubtensorModule::RAORecycledForRegistrationSet`. **No `Balances`-pallet event of any kind is
  ingested by this codebase's `account_events` pipeline** (`INGESTED_EVENT_KINDS`,
  `src/account-events.mjs`, is SubtensorModule-only plus a hardcoded `Transfer` — confirmed by
  reading the full list) — so even the correct on-chain signal isn't currently captured.
- `subnet_hyperparams_history` (#4309) captures only `min_burn_tao`/`max_burn_tao` — the
  _bounds_ on the dynamic burn — never the live current cost at any given block.

So there is no existing capture this repo has today that reconstructs a per-registration burn
amount, contradicting the issue's stated approach. **What _is_ available, and simpler than any
log-layer join:** `SubtensorModule::RAORecycledForRegistration` is a plain on-chain
`StorageMap<NetUid, u64>` — the chain's own running total of rao recycled for registration on
that subnet, confirmed to equal exactly the `amount` in the same block's
`RAORecycledForRegistrationSet` event (154,463,660,642 rao = 154.463660642 TAO for netuid 101 at
that block). A single `state_getStorage` query returns it directly — the same live-RPC +
KV-cache shape this repo already uses for `/accounts/{ss58}/balance` and `/sudo/key`
(`src/account-balance.mjs`, `src/sudo-key.mjs`), not a new capture pipeline. Storage key =
`twox128("SubtensorModule") ++ twox128("RAORecycledForRegistration") ++ <netuid as u16,
little-endian, Identity hasher — no hash on the map key>`, confirmed via
`substrate.create_storage_key(...)` across netuid 0/1/4/101/65535. Shipped as
`GET /api/v1/subnets/{netuid}/recycled` (`src/subnet-recycled.mjs`) on this basis instead of the
issue's literal log-layer approach.

## Design spike: rate-limited public state-query endpoint (#4344/9.1, 2026-07-09)

Goal (the issue's own framing): expose `state_getStorage`/`state_getKeysPaged`/`state_getPairs`
through a scoped, rate-limited public proxy — a differentiator vs. taostats gating the
equivalent behind a paid key. **Extend the existing RPC proxy allowlist model
(`workers/config.mjs`/`workers/request-handlers/rpc-proxy.mjs`, live at `POST /rpc/v1/finney`,
`docs/operations.md` "RPC Proxy (enabled)"), not a new pipeline.** That proxy already enforces,
today, for its `SAFE_RPC_METHODS` allowlist: a method allowlist + `DENIED_RPC_PREFIXES`, an
upstream SSRF guard (`TRUSTED_RPC_UPSTREAM_ORIGINS`, https/wss-only, no private IPs), weighted
load balancing across the eligible pool, a 64 KB body cap, a 10 s upstream timeout, single
(non-batched) JSON-RPC objects only, and a 100 req/60 s per-client-IP rate limit via the
`RPC_RATE_LIMITER` binding. `state_getStorage` and `state_getMetadata` are explicitly named in
that allowlist's own comment as excluded "heavy reads" — this spike is the design for lifting
that exclusion safely for three specific methods, not a blanket unblock.

**Why these three methods need more than the existing allowlist gives them:** every other
`SAFE_RPC_METHODS` entry (`chain_getBlock`, `system_health`, …) either takes no caller-supplied
parameter or one bounded by the chain itself (a block hash/number). All three state-query methods
take a caller-supplied storage key or prefix with no natural bound:

| Method               | Caller input                          | Abuse shape if unbounded                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `state_getStorage`   | one storage key (hex)                 | Cheap per-call, but an unbounded key length/count is still a batching-via-repetition vector.                                                         |
| `state_getKeysPaged` | prefix + page size + start key        | An uncapped page size returns the full keyspace under a prefix in one shot.                                                                          |
| `state_getPairs`     | prefix only, **no pagination at all** | Can return every key **and value** under a prefix in a single response — the whole pallet's storage for a shallow prefix. This is the dangerous one. |

None of this is a _confidentiality_ problem — subtensor has no private storage; every value here
is already public consensus state (the same reasoning `authority: "community"` surfaces and this
repo's own `RAORecycledForRegistration` read above rely on). The risk is purely **cost/availability
abuse**: a caller scripting `state_getPairs` against a shallow prefix (or even the empty prefix)
can force the upstream RPC endpoint to serialize and return an arbitrarily large chunk of chain
state in one request, at zero cost to the caller and real cost (CPU + egress) to metagraphed's own
pooled RPC endpoints and Worker subrequest budget.

### Recommended shape

1. **A separate, stricter method allowlist tier** — do not add these three to `SAFE_RPC_METHODS`
   directly (that set's callers expect the existing 100/60s budget and no extra param
   validation). Introduce `SAFE_RPC_STATE_QUERY_METHODS` alongside it in `workers/config.mjs`:

   ```js
   export const SAFE_RPC_STATE_QUERY_METHODS = new Set([
     "state_getStorage",
     "state_getKeysPaged",
     // state_getPairs excluded — see below.
   ]);
   ```

   `isSafeRpcMethod`-equivalent dispatch checks this set _in addition to_ `SAFE_RPC_METHODS`, but
   only when the request additionally passes the param-shape and rate-limit gates below — it is
   not a plain allowlist entry, it is a second, narrower gate.

2. **Exclude `state_getPairs` from the public surface entirely (for now).** It is the one method
   in this family with no caller-side pagination — `state_getKeysPaged` already covers the
   legitimate "enumerate a prefix" use case with a bounded page size, and pairs-with-values-in-one-
   shot has no safe upper bound short of hard-capping the prefix depth. If a real use case surfaces
   that `state_getKeysPaged` + N `state_getStorage` calls can't serve, revisit as its own follow-up
   with a mandatory minimum prefix length (e.g. requiring the full two-`twox128` pallet+item prefix,
   never a bare pallet prefix or the empty prefix) rather than shipping it open-ended now.

3. **Param validation, enforced before the upstream fetch (in the same request-shape check that
   already rejects batched/non-single JSON-RPC bodies):**
   - `state_getStorage`: `params[0]` must be a `0x`-prefixed hex string, length-capped (e.g. 256
     bytes decoded — comfortably above any real storage key, which is always
     `twox128 + twox128 + hasher(map key)` = well under 128 bytes even for a `Blake2_128Concat`
     key on a 32-byte AccountId).
   - `state_getKeysPaged`: `params[0]` (prefix) same hex validation; `params[1]` (count) hard-capped
     server-side (rewrite the request to `min(caller_count, 250)` rather than reject it — mirrors
     how paginated REST routes in this repo clamp rather than error on an over-large `?limit`,
     `clampInt` in `workers/config.mjs`).
   - Reject a missing/malformed key or prefix with the same `errorResponse("rpc_invalid_request", …,
400)` shape the existing body-shape check uses — no new error taxonomy needed.

4. **A separate, stricter Cloudflare Rate Limiting binding** (`STATE_QUERY_RATE_LIMITER`, its own
   `wrangler.jsonc` binding + WAF zone rule scoped to a distinguishing path or the JSON-RPC
   `method` field) — proposed **20 requests / 60 s per client IP**, a fifth of the general RPC
   proxy's 100/60s. Keeping it a _separate_ binding (not a lower shared bucket) means heavy
   state-query traffic from one client can't starve that same client's ordinary `chain_getBlock`/
   `system_health` calls through the same proxy, and vice versa — the two tiers fail independently.
   Reuses the exact `RPC_RATE_LIMITER` wiring shape (`resolveClientIp`, `429 rpc_rate_limited` with
   `retry-after`/`x-ratelimit-*` headers) already in `rpc-proxy.mjs`, just against the new binding
   and limit constant.

5. **A post-fetch response-size cap.** Even with `state_getKeysPaged`'s count clamped, a pathological
   prefix (or a future param-validation gap) could still return a large payload — cap the decoded
   upstream response body (e.g. 256 KB, matching this proxy's existing 64 KB _request_ cap's order
   of magnitude) and surface `502 rpc_response_too_large` rather than relaying it, mirroring the
   `MAX_STAGED_*_BYTES` "parse-safety ceiling" pattern already used for staged ingest bodies
   elsewhere in this codebase (`workers/config.mjs`).

6. **No new endpoint path.** Route through the same `POST /rpc/v1/finney` proxy (`workers/
request-handlers/rpc-proxy.mjs`) rather than a dedicated `/rpc/v1/finney/state` — the method
   name in the JSON-RPC body already disambiguates, and a second path would duplicate the SSRF
   guard, pool selection, and upstream-fetch logic for no isolation benefit (the rate-limit and
   param-validation gates above are per-_method_, not per-_path_, so they compose cleanly into the
   existing single entry point).

### Explicitly out of scope for this spike

- `state_call` (arbitrary runtime-API invocation) stays in `DENIED_RPC_PREFIXES` — categorically
  more dangerous than a storage read (it can invoke _any_ runtime API method, not just read a
  known key) and not part of the issue's own ask.
- `grandpa_proveFinality` (#4344/9.3) is a sibling issue in this epic with its own, unrelated
  shape (a finality proof for a given block, not a keyspace query) — no shared design surface with
  this spike beyond both landing on the same allowlist infrastructure.
- The internal, already-shipped `state_getStorage` calls this repo makes itself for known,
  hardcoded storage keys (`src/account-balance.mjs`, `src/sudo-key.mjs`, `src/subnet-recycled.mjs`)
  are unaffected — those are server-to-upstream calls with no caller-supplied key, not routed
  through the public RPC proxy at all, and need no new gate.

### Deliverable for 9.2 (#4346)

Implement `SAFE_RPC_STATE_QUERY_METHODS` (2 methods only) + the param-validation/count-clamp step

- the separate `STATE_QUERY_RATE_LIMITER` binding + the response-size cap in
  `workers/request-handlers/rpc-proxy.mjs`, following the exact wiring shape `RPC_RATE_LIMITER`
  already establishes. `docs/operations.md`'s "RPC Proxy (enabled)" section and
  `docs/beta-roadmap.md`'s "Phase 2 — RPC proxy differentiator" bullet should both gain a line once
  shipped, matching how the existing method allowlist is documented there today.
