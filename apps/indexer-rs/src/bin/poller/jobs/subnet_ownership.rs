// subnet-ownership -- the first job built natively in the poller
// (metagraphed-infra#138). Closes the gap JSONbored/metagraphed#6644 found:
// no clean provider<->owner mapping exists on-chain anywhere in this
// codebase. Resolves the REAL owning account for every currently-registered
// subnet via the same two-step chain read scripts/fetch-subnet-locks.py
// already established for its own owner-lock rows:
//
//   1. SubtensorModule::SubnetOwnerHotkey(netuid) -> the owner's hotkey
//   2. SubtensorModule::Owner(hotkey)             -> the owning account
//
// (Owner is confirmed against the official bittensor Python SDK's own
// resolution, bittensor/core/subtensor.py -- both storage items are
// ValueQuery, defaulting to the zero account [0u8; 32] rather than erroring
// when unset. A hotkey with no registered owner resolves to that zero
// account, same as the SDK's own callers treat it: no owning account, not a
// literal owner.)
//
// The active netuid set is discovered by iterating
// SubtensorModule::NetworksAdded (a StorageMap<NetUid, bool> -- the runtime's
// own "does this subnet exist" flag) rather than a hardcoded upper bound, so
// a newly-registered or deregistered subnet is picked up automatically on
// the next tick with no code change.
//
// Gathers the whole snapshot in memory before writing (same shape as
// scripts/fetch-account-balances.py / scripts/fetch-subnet-hyperparams.py):
// a tick either upserts a complete, consistent snapshot, or -- if too many
// netuids failed to resolve -- returns Err and writes nothing at all, never
// a half-scanned partial snapshot silently overwriting a good one.
//
// PERFORMANCE (live-verified 2026-07-19 against the public archive RPC): one
// `ChainClient::call(api.at_current_block())` up front for the whole tick,
// then every storage read below goes directly through that single cached
// `AtBlock` -- NOT through another `ChainClient::call` per read. An earlier
// version called `at_current_block()` fresh inside every single storage
// fetch (~260 extra round-trips for 129 netuids x 2 lookups each); against
// a public endpoint that made a full tick take minutes instead of seconds.
// `backfill_rs::AtBlock`'s own doc comment carries this same warning for the
// next job added here. Losing ChainClient::call's stall-timeout/reconnect
// wrapper on these individual reads is an accepted tradeoff, not an
// oversight: connect_chain()'s LegacyBackend already structurally avoids the
// chainHead_v1_follow stall class (subxt#2050) these reads could otherwise
// hit, the ReconnectingRpcClient's own 60s request_timeout still bounds any
// single stateless call, and a whole-tick failure just retries on the next
// scheduled interval -- an acceptable cost for a periodic poller, unlike
// main.rs's live-follow hot path this same reasoning would NOT apply to.
//
// subnet_ownership_history (metagraphed#6970): subnet_ownership above is
// latest-only -- an ownership change just overwrites the previous row with
// no trace. Every tick now also fetches the CURRENT state of
// subnet_ownership before writing (one query, not per-netuid) and appends a
// subnet_ownership_history row only when a netuid's resolved owner differs
// from what's already stored, or has never been stored at all -- same
// diff-based-append convention as subnet_hyperparams_history/neuron_daily,
// so a subnet whose ownership never changes accumulates exactly one history
// row (its first observation), not one per poll tick forever.
